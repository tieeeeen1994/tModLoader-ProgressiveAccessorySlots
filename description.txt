Do you want accessory slots, but it was rewarded to you as consumables? Fear not! Another mod was born for that. Here is the link to the mod:

I have fixed the flashing screen error. Please let me know if anybody is still experiencing the issue.

This mod is a continuation of the Extra Accessory Slots by Aubrey (since Steam names can change, I will link the profile of the author below.)

The mod makes every boss, event, or event boss give you an extra accessory slot on the first kill with a config allowing you to choose which give a slot, all disabled by default.

Most accessory slots are tied to the world. Only Torch God event is tied to the player in vanilla. The mod implements tModLoader's API for adding modded accessories.
All vanilla bosses and events are supported.
Added support for mods:
- Calamity, thanks to ProfiFaust (https://steamcommunity.com/id/ProfiFaust/) for pointing out what strings are needed.
