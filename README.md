# Progressive Accessory Slots

This mod is a continuation of the Extra Accessory Slots by Aubrey (since Steam names can change, I will link the profile of the author below.)

The mod makes every boss, event, or event boss give you an extra accessory slot on the first kill with a config allowing you to choose which give a slot, all disabled by default.

Most accessory slots are tied to the world. Only Torch God event is tied to the player in vanilla. This mod only supports vanilla content. The mod also implements tModLoader's API for adding modded accessories.
